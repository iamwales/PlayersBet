          <span className="head">Proof:</span>You will need a screenshot of the
          "Post Match Results" showing the final score of the three players. But
          video proof is the best evidence you can provide.

          WARNING: If you add kills to your score that are from AFTER being
          revived, you're subject to being fined and or suspended. Reviving the
          3rd random player IS allowed. Self-resurrecting yourself with a "Level
          4 Knockdown Shield" is also allowed. ALL disputes related to this
          issue require full video evidence leading up to the revive.

          while youâ€™re downed count towards your final score. Kills scored after
          you die do not count towards your final score (e.g. from explosives,
          or someone that you knocked down bleeding out). ALL disputes related
          to this issue require full match video evidence.

          involving interference or in-game exploits. While we make the best

          and you must provide video evidence proving how many kills you had.
          Your opponent can continue to play even after you have disconnected
          from the match.
